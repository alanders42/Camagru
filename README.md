# Camagru
Camagru is a web-based app that allows you to make basic photo and video editing using your webcam and some predefined images. Users will be able to select an image in a list of superposable images, take a picture with his/her webcam and admire the result that should be mixing both pictures. All captured images are public, likeable and can be commented on.
